# Daniel Gonzálvez Alfert

Quantitatively minded software engineer with a background in **Computer Science & Mathematics**, currently finishing an MSc in **Quantum Information Science** at the University of Copenhagen. 

I work comfortably across **backend development**, **data analysis**, and **statistical modelling**, with a strong bias toward building systems that are *reliable, reproducible, and understandable*. I enjoy problems that sit at the boundary between theory, engineering, and real-world decision-making.

## What I work on

- **Backend & systems** — Python services, clean architecture, documentation-first workflows  
- **Data & modelling** — statistical analysis, Monte Carlo methods, validation, exploratory analysis  
- **Research tooling** — reproducible pipelines for noisy, data-intensive environments  
- **Production environments** — CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, working under constraints
